## How do I get started?
To get started with Carloop, all you need is the following:
- Carloop Basic: [https://store.carloop.io/products/carloop-basic](https://goo.gl/QXREmq)
- OSX/Windows/Linux to program and flash
- Micro-usb to USB cable

### The Hardware Pieces Explained
Carloop Basic is a pre-built kit which comes with a Carloop [https://store.carloop.io/products/carloop](https://goo.gl/qSsLV8) plus a Particle Photon.  The Particle Photon is a microcontroller that comes with a CAN bus and a WiFi radio.  We've looked at many options out there and this was the easiest development kit we could find!
